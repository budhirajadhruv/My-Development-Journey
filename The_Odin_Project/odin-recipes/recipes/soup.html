    You can make this cream of broccoli soup recipe in about a half an hour, so it's the perfect choice for busy weeknights. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Cook the Vegetables
Sauté the onions and celery in butter until they're tender. Add the broccoli florets and the chicken broth, cover the pot, and simmer for about 10 minutes.

Blend the Ingredients
You can use a countertop blender or an immersion blender to purée the soup. Give it a few quick pulses, then blend continuously until the soup is totally smooth.

Thicken the Soup
Melt a few tablespoons of butter in a separate saucepan. Stir in the flour, then the milk. Cook the milk mixture until it's thick and bubbly, then add it to the soup. Finish it off with a dash of pepper (and the other seasonings of your choosing).
